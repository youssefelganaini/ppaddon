# PowerPoint Add-On

## Description

This fun side-project is intended to be used an internal tool in Academy Consult to automate some of the recurring tasks in creating slide decks. Here are a few features on the roadmap:

1. Automating Alignment Checks
2. Generating Action Titles
3. Providing feedback on written content of the slides

These are the three features we found out were most critical. There is also more planned, but these are the ones we will focus on.

As of now (26 Jan 2024), we have been able to parse PowerPoint slides to extract Action Titles and generate feedback and recommendations via the OpenAI API.
